## üß† Function Calling Support

This app supports OpenAI function calling for:

| Function Name         | Purpose                          | Related File                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `get_leave_policy`    | Vacation, sick, and unpaid leave | `Leave Benefits for Employees.docx` |
| `get_overtime_policy` | Overtime rules and compensation  | `Regulation Working Overtime.docx`  |
| `get_workplace_rules` | General internal regulations     | `Regulation Internal Labor.docx`    |

These files are placed inside the `doc/` folder.

---

## üìÑ Uploading Files (Not Implementation)

User-uploaded `.txt`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` files are processed (but currently not yet integrated with chat context). You can expand this by injecting uploaded content into conversation history or embedding retrieval pipeline.

---

## üõ° Error Handling

* Frontend JavaScript displays error messages returned from backend APIs.
* Backend routes return appropriate JSON errors with `status_code 400/404/500` if needed.
* Errors from document reading and API calls are printed in console and relayed back.

---

## üîß Customization

* To modify system prompt: edit `prompt/system_prompt.txt`
* To add more few-shot examples: edit `prompt/few_shot_examples.json`
* To add new policies: drop new `.docx/.pdf` files into `doc/` and define a new function
